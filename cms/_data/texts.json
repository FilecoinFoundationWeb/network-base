This calls into question the sustainability of these important resources and suggests that research and collaboration are hindered by the current centralized paradigm. In contrast, decentralized infrastructure for geospatial data could result in fewer data silos, increased trust, and the democratization of data stewardship. ","-3176cddf":"This would enable easier collaboration between researchers, universities, and governments while providing citizens with unrestricted access to open data. In response, The EASIER Data Initiative aims to leverage the decentralized web for sharing geospatial data more efficiently, accessibly, and sustainably. The Initiative has made one year of Landsat 9 data (300 TB) available on Filecoin and accessible through IPFS, to demonstrate how this can help remove barriers to access. ","-86d3f7e":"Additionally, the Initiative is exploring solutions for integrating existing geospatial technologies with web2, as well as Data DAOs for collaborative data stewardship. To promote collaboration, we established the Decentralized Geospatial Web Working Group (dGWWG) and invite interested parties to join the community and participate in the development of the decentralized geospatial web.
