This calls into question the sustainability of these important resources and suggests that research and collaboration are hindered by the current centralized paradigm. In contrast, decentralized infrastructure for geospatial data could result in fewer data silos, increased trust, and the democratization of data stewardship.

In response, The EASIER Data Initiative aims to leverage the decentralized web for sharing geospatial data more efficiently, accessibly, and sustainably.
